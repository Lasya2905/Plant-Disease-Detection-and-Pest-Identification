# Plant Disease Detection and Pest Identification

This project focuses on detecting plant diseases and identifying pests using image processing and deep learning.  
The project is implemented using Python in Google Colab with the help of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The system takes an image of a plant leaf as input and predicts whether the plant is healthy, affected by a disease, or affected by pests.

## Project Description

Plant diseases and pests reduce crop productivity and quality. Identifying them manually is difficult and time-consuming.  
In this project, a deep learning model is trained using plant leaf images to automatically detect diseases and pests.

The entire project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook using Google Colab.
